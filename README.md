# The PhotoWall Slideshow in Rust

```bash
$ cargo run <directory_path>

### Dependencies

* Raylib 5.5 (must be installed with its build dependencies)

Fixes are mine :) 

Gemini insisted on using deprecated `rand` methods and never accepted that `kamadak-exif` is now available within the `Exif` module.
